# Data Analysis of US Bikeshare Data

> *This project was completed to satisfy the requirements of the
[Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104_variant_b)
and is meant to be educational in nature.*

The code developed helps to investigate US Bikeshare Data in an efficient manner. At a high level,
users can review statistics and key analytics about rideshare users in Washington, New York City and Chicago.
[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) is providing all three data files which contain randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017.

## Calculated Statistics

Users can receive the following statistics using this code:

- Popular times of travel
  - most common month
  - most common day of week
  - most common hour of day
- Popular stations and trip
  - most common start station
  - most common end station
  - most common trip from start to end
- Trip duration
  - total travel time
  - average travel time
- User info
  - counts of each user type
  - counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
  - earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

## Potential Next Steps

With the User info given it might be valuable of creating a most common user profile. With
this information the Rideshare company will be able to target its users even better and
also advertise the service among non-regular-users more.


## What's in the repository?

- [bikeshare.py](./bikeshare.py): Python file that contains all code for this project.
- [chicago.csv](.chicago.csv): Chicago Rideshare data file
- [new_york_city.csv](.new_york_city.csv): New York City Rideshare data file
- [washington.csv](.washington.csv): Washington Rideshare data file

Inspiration for this README file came from my partner
[Orlando Castillo](https://github.com/ojcastillo/sparkify/blob/master/README.md) who has greatly supported me on my journey of
becoming a Data Analyst.
